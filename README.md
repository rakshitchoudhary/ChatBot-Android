# ChatBot-Android

This is a demo chat bot application. I created a free AI brain account at Brainshop.ai(https://brainshop.ai). 
Once the account is created, you can create your own questionare based on the responses you require in the app.

In the app, you have to implement API calling in order to communicate with the Brainshop server. You send the question asked as request and get response from the server.
Once the connection is done, you can show the data in list or in whichever way you seem fit.
